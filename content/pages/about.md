Hi! I'm Naomi. I'm a young transgender woman living in Perth, Western Australia. My hobbies include photography, anime, and music.  

I take photos using an Asahi Pentax Spotmatic SP II, a Canon EOS M3, and a decrepit old Sony CyberShot. You can take a look at the results [here](/gallery).  

I try to listen to as much music as I can from as many backgrounds as possible. At the moment I've got a soft spot for bands like Mogwai, Ganger, and 65daysofstatic. If you want to share anything with me please go ahead!  

I make electronic music using [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/) and my Novation Circuit [groovebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovebox). I've been trying to get better at live improvisation and find ways to integrate it into my studio tracks. If you're interested, you can check out some of my unreleased tunes [here](https://soundcloud.com/falseset/sets/demos-other/s-avFukOToHCA). You should also keep an eye on my [BandCamp](https://falseset.bandcamp.com/).  

Right now I've got a passing interest in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/). My interest in Rust was piqued by finding out about the [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) templating engine, which helped alleviate some of my frustation with [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/). I've been using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) as daily drivers on my desktop and laptop respectively.  

If you need to contact me you can reach me through the following:
