Over August I tried to broaden my horizons - I went through and listened to a bunch of music I've had in my backlog for a long time - but I fell in love with an album I heard for the first time just before the end of the month.

After going to Japan earlier this year, I have been playing through as many arcade shoot-'em-ups as I can. I was never particularly into them as an adult, but my curiosity had always been there as I had played my fair share through Taito shovelware compilations for the PlayStation 2 and other western rereleases.  

I picked up a bunch of games a few Steam sales ago, DoDonPachi Resurrection being one of them. I had played the mobile version of Resurrection and a few original CAVE cabinets at HEY in Akihabara, but I had yet to experience everything the game had to offer.   

The synth work sounds halfway between something you'd hear out of a YM2612 and Invaders Must Die by The Prodigy, the drum work in some of the earlier tracks being remeniscent of the latter too.
