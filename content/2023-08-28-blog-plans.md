Considering I've been very lax with updating my past blogs, I've decided that I'm going to set out some plans for posting to this one.  

<!-- more -->

I've got a few ideas in mind that I'm keen to try out:  

 - Writing a paragraph on my favourite albums over the previous month
 - Breaking down and documenting my music production efforts
 - Taking and posting a photo every week to track my improvement

I'll try my best to hold myself to these, in the odd chance that someone out there is reading them religiously (or at all.)
