Hi! I'm Naomi. I'm a young transgender woman living in Perth, Western Australia. 

In my spare time I find myself making electronic music using a variety of different hardware and software. I'm particularly interested in [Grooveboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovebox), a form factor similar to that of a desktop synthesizer but often containing features such as sequencers and mixers.
